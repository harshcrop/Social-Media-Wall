# Social Media Wall

Create a livestream of Twitter and Instagram pictures to be shown during your event.

I created this project while I was looking for a way to show twitter or instagram picutres being posted by guests on the big screen. There are multiple commercial solutions for this but most of them are quite costly. So with some helpfull guides on the interenet I was able to create something myself.
